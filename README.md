This script iterates over all files in the specified directory (files/), reads the content of each file, and merges them into a single CSV file (merged.csv). It concatenates the contents of all files into the CSV file.

Ensure that the directory containing the files you want to merge is named files and placed in the project folder.

Run the script:

``python file_merger.py``
